## Methodology

Our PVI is a Minnesota-specific version of the [Cook Partisan Index (CPVI)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook_Partisan_Voting_Index), which measures how strongly a geographic area leans toward one political party.

Each district is assigned a PVI value, which shows its political leaning. R+12, for example, denotes that district leans Republican by 12 percentage points, whereas D+2 would represent a two percentage point leaning toward the Democratic party. EVENÂ means a political leaning of less than one percentage point.

Our calculations use three recent races:

- 2006 state house
- 2008 state house
- 2010 state house

Using a spatial database process, we matched up each precinct to its newly assigned district. For example, a precinct with a [geometric centroid](http://postgis.refractions.net/docs/ST_Centroid.html) in district 21A would be considered part of that district.

We then add up the total votes for each party per 2012 district, for each race. These numbers are turned into a PVI index as follows:

```
100 * (Votes for a republican candidate / Total number of votes) - (Votes for a democratic candidate / Total number of votes)
```

This is calculated for each race. The average of these gives the overall PVI used in our visualization. These numbers are then rounded to the nearest whole number and assigned a party for readability.
